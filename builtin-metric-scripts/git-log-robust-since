# Normal "git log --since FOO" follows all parents and stops when it finds a
# commit with commit date older than FOO. In reality it's quite common that
# people commit with incorrect time configured on their machines, or they
# might use env variable COMMITTER_DATE="" etc. This script is a variant of
# the normal "git log --since" that waits until it has seen "N different devs
# commit with commit dates older than FOO" before it stops printing.
